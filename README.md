<h1>TITLE OF PROJECT</h1>
<p><strong>PacMan Movement Exercise</strong></p>

<h2>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>This project displays and moves a PacMan image from one side of the screen to the other using screen edge detection. Each time one clicks "Add a Pacman," a new Pacman element is added to the screen. Clicking "Start a Game" causes each Pacman element to bounce around the screen without going off the edge. Repeatedly clicking "Start a Game" causes the Pacman elements' speed to increase.</p>

<h2>FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS</h2>
<p>In the future I would like to improve the exercise by adding a feature that will cause the PacMan image to move across the screen as the mouse moves.</p>

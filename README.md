<h1>TITLE OF PROJECT</h1>
<p>PacMan Movement Exercise</p>

<h2>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>This project displays and moves a PacMan image from one side of the screen to the other using screen edge detection. Each time one clicks "Add a Pacman," a new Pacman element is added to the screen. Clicking "Start a Game" causes each Pacman element to bounce around the screen without going off the edge. Repeatedly clicking "Start a Game" causes the Pacman elements' speed to increase.</p>

<h2>HOW TO RUN</h2>
<u1>
<li>Clone this repository.</li>
<li>Open the index.html file in the browser.</li>
<li>Click "Add a Pacman" button to make a new PacMan image appear on the screen.</li>
<li>Click "Start a Game" to add motion to the PacMan image.</li>
<li>Increase the speed of the bouncing images each time you click "Start a Game."</li>
</u1>

<h2>FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS</h2>
<p>In the future I would like to improve the exercise by adding a feature that will cause the PacMan image to move across the screen as the mouse moves.</p>
